# READ ME
This plugin is practicly useless until I fix it, or someone does idk.
So yeah just don't use it.

# Server-Pass
Protect your server with a password!
(Even tho you should use steamid auth, you can still use this tho)

## Config
```
sp_password | default: none | description: The password to the server.
sp_status | default: true | description: If the plugin should activate.
```

## Install
put the thing in the thing then change the default password **OR IT WILL NOT RUN!**, because the default password is easy to guess.
Then ya'll gucci.

## How to use
when you join the server, it will ask for a password in you're console, type the command `passwd` then the argument which is you're password. Like this `passwd GayPassWord`
If it's accepted it wont kick you, otherwise it will.
